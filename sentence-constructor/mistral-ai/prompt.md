        Here's the essential vocabulary:

        |----------|---------|-----------|
        | 死ぬ     | shinu   | die       |

        | 花       | hana    | flower    |

        | 後悔     | koukai  | regret    |
        | 強い     | tsuyoi  | strong    |

        Hints to help you construct the sentence:

        When comparing two things in Japanese, use より (yori) for "than"
        の方が (no hou ga) is used to emphasize the comparison
        なぜなら (nazenara) means "because"
        You'll need to modify 死ぬ (shinu) into its past participle form to describe "dead people"
        Think about how to make 強い (tsuyoi) into a comparative form

        Would you like specific hints about any particular part of the sentence?
